# Temp Directory

This directory contains temporary files, scripts, and organizational documents.

## Contents

- **Organizational files**: Project reorganization documentation
- **Temporary scripts**: One-time use scripts and tools
- **Build artifacts**: Temporary build files (if any)
- **Notes and drafts**: Work-in-progress documentation

## Note

Files in this directory are generally temporary and may be cleaned up periodically. Important files should be moved to appropriate permanent locations:

- Documentation → `../Documents/`
- Source code → `../Utilities/development/src/`
- Build tools → `../Utilities/development/`
- Configuration → Root directory or appropriate subdirectory

## Gitignore

Temporary file types (*.tmp, *.temp, *.bak, *.backup) are ignored by git but the folder structure is tracked.
