# Framework74 Home

This is the home directory for the Framework74 system. All core modules, assets, documentation, and database solutions for Roblox game and app development will be managed here.

## Migration Plan
- This directory is designed for future migration of the current LuneProjects repo into a larger Framework74 repository.
- All submodules and systems will be integrated for seamless expansion.

## Structure
- `database/` — Game/app data, analytics, tracking, and solution catalogs
- `assets/` — Media, 3D, GUI, and project assets
- `docs/` — Documentation, standards, and planning
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts and helpers
- `src/` — Main source code
- `tests/` — Test suites
- `tags/` — Open-source/restricted tagging

## Continuous Improvement
- Directory structure, integration, and documentation will be regularly reviewed and improved.
- Analytics and tracking will be implemented for all systems.
