# Framework74 Design Prototypes & System Analysis

## 1. Modular System Architecture
- **Directory-Driven Logic:** Each major system (AI, assets, database, scripts, frameworks) is isolated for easy migration, testing, and scaling.
- **Plug-and-Play Modules:** New features (e.g., analytics, new GUIs, game mechanics) are added as modules in `/frameworks/` or `/scripts/` and registered via config/JSON.
- **Tagging & Access Control:** `/tags/open-source/` and `/tags/restricted/` enable safe code sharing and internal-only logic.

## 2. Database & Data Flow
- **Hybrid Storage:** Use local JSON for static/config data and cloud NoSQL for player data, analytics, and live state.
- **Schema Versioning:** Store schema versions in JSON for easy migration and rollback.
- **Event Logging:** All major actions/events are logged for analytics and debugging.

## 3. AI & Automation
- **Custom Prompts & Chat Modes:** `/ai/` holds reusable prompts, chat modes, and Copilot instructions for rapid onboarding and automation.
- **AI Agents:** `/ai/agents/` for custom scripts that automate tasks, code review, or asset management.
- **Analytics Integration:** AI can analyze logs and suggest improvements.

## 4. Asset & Media Management
- **Centralized Asset Index:** `/assets/` folders are indexed in `/database/project-metadata.json` for search and reuse.
- **Per-Project Asset Folders:** `/assets/project-specific/` keeps each game's assets organized and portable.

## 5. Documentation & Tracking
- **Docs as Source of Truth:** `/docs/` and `/framework74/docs/` are always up to date, with migration, integration, and improvement plans.
- **Creative Journey:** Track inspiration, design decisions, and lessons learned in `CREATIVE_JOURNEY.md`.

## 6. Analytics & Continuous Improvement
- **Event Hooks:** All systems emit analytics events (usage, errors, performance) to `/database/` or cloud.
- **Automated Reports:** Scripts generate dashboards and improvement suggestions.
- **Regular Reviews:** Schedule reviews of structure, integration, and analytics.

## Next Steps
- Prototype a modular game system in `/frameworks/` using these patterns.
- Implement analytics hooks in a sample script or module.
- Expand asset indexing and tagging for searchability.
- Continuously document and review all new systems.
