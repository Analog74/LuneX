# Framework74 Database Solutions Guide

## Recommended Approaches for Roblox Game/App Development

### 1. JSON-Based Storage
- Use for configuration, static data, GUIs, and reference catalogs.
- Easy to version, diff, and migrate.
- Native support in Roblox via HttpService:JSONEncode/Decode.

### 2. NoSQL (Cloud/Hybrid)
- Use for player data, analytics, and scalable game state.
- Firebase, MongoDB Atlas, or Supabase for cloud; Rojo for local dev.
- Integrate with Roblox via REST APIs or custom modules.

### 3. Analytics & Tracking
- Store analytics events in NoSQL or append-only JSON logs.
- Use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or custom endpoints for advanced tracking.
- Export data for visualization and improvement.

### 4. Hybrid Approach
- Combine local JSON for static/config data with cloud NoSQL for dynamic/player data.
- Modular adapters for easy migration and scaling.

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review new database tools and APIs for Roblox.
- Automate data backups and migrations.
- Document all schemas and integration points in `/framework74/database/`.
