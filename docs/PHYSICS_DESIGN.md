# Framework74 Physics System Design Guide

This guide outlines the types of physics control available in Framework74 and how to implement them in your game projects.

## 1. Character Movement Physics
- Configure walking, running, jumping, double jumps, and special moves.
- Example: `character_physics.json` for speed, jump height, and custom actions.

## 2. Spell and Ability Physics
- Define projectile speed, trajectory, area effects, and environmental manipulation.
- Example: `spells_physics.json` for fireballs, knockback, and terrain effects.

## 3. Environmental Physics
- Adjust gravity, friction, and create unique physics zones.
- Example: `environment_physics.json` for global and zone-based settings.

## 4. Object Interactions
- Control collisions, joints, constraints, and custom forces.
- Example: `object_physics.json` for collision rules and dynamic connections.

## 5. Character Physics Customization
- Set mass, gravity overrides, and unique movement mechanics per character.

## 6. Physics for Visual Effects
- Enable ragdoll, destructible environments, and dynamic animations.

## 7. Multiplayer Physics Synchronization
- Ensure consistent physics across clients, with server-side authority for fairness.

## Implementation
- Use modular configs and scripts in `/frameworks/physics-system/`.
- Extend or override for each game or framework as needed.
- See code stubs in the physics-system module for starting points.
