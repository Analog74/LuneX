# Asset Management in Framework74

## Overview
Framework74 centralizes asset storage and indexing for all projects, supporting media, 3D, GUI, tutorials, and more.

## Structure
- `/assets/` for all asset types
- `/database/project-metadata.json` for asset indexing and metadata
- Per-project asset folders for organization and portability

## Best Practices
- Index all assets in the metadata JSON for searchability
- Tag assets for type, usage, and access level
- Document asset usage in relevant module or project docs

## Continuous Improvement
- Expand asset types and tagging as new needs arise
- Regularly review and clean up unused or outdated assets
