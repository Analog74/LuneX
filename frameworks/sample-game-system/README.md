# Sample Game System (Framework74 Prototype)

This is a prototype modular game system for Framework74, demonstrating:
- Modular directory structure
- Analytics event hooks
- Asset indexing
- JSON-based config and state

## Structure
- `main.py` — Entry point, system logic
- `analytics.py` — Analytics event logging
- `assets.json` — Indexed assets used by this module
- `config.json` — Module configuration

## Integration
- Designed for plug-and-play in Framework74
- Emits analytics events to `/framework74/database/` or cloud
- Assets referenced from `/assets/` and indexed in `assets.json`
